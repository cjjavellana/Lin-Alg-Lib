# Lin Alg Lib

Short for Linear Algebra Library.

Inspired by Python's numpy library. This project is not meant to be used anywhere except for educational purposes i.e. Implement linear algebra algorithm from scratch, learn C++ along the way.

## Prerequisites

1. C++ Compiler. Clang++ or g++ should be fine.

Do note that you may need to update the `Makefile` and tasks.json

## TODO

1. Multi-thread on larger vectors / matrices

2. Add CUDA Support

3. Reduce code duplication in vectors.cpp with the use of lambda.

4. Unit Test. Stop testing using the main function.
